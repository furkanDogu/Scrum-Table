# Scrum-Table

Here we are with our "Software Construction Final Project" also known as Huddle. My classmate (Semih Omur) and I have developed a basic scrum table that have functions below

- saving user stories
- saving tasks
- drag&drop between phases

We also used Singleton Design Pattern in our main class to avoid passing references between forms and classes. In Huddle it is possible to create more than one
projects. The projects may have different owners, deadlines and responsible people. 

Finally, we want to thank you our instructor Emin Borandag who has given homeworks that helps us expand our horizons in programming.
